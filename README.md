# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the recipe page centered on the screen  
- Read ingredients, preparation time, and instructions clearly  
- See responsive styling on different screen sizes (if implemented)

## My Process

### Built With

- *HTML5 semantic markup*  
- *CSS3* (Flexbox / Custom properties)  
- *Responsive layout* (if applied)

### What I Learned

While building this project, I reinforced:

- Proper structuring of semantic HTML for readability and accessibility  
- Styling a clean card layout with centered alignment  
- How to visually group sections like "Preparation Time" using background highlights

Here’s a snippet I’m proud of:

```html
<section class="preparation-time">
  <h3>Preparation time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total:</strong> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 5 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> 5 minutes</li>
  </ul>
</section>
